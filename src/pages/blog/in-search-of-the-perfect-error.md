Sometimes you don't event match the error all you need a simple message.

```rust
pub struct Error(String)
```

Well let's say you're writing a parser every error will have a line and a column.

```rust
pub struct ParseError{
	line: u64,
	col: u64,
	kind: ParseErrorKind
}

pub enum ParseErrorKind{

}
```
