The Fermi Paradox is the discrepancy between the lack of conclusive evidence of extra-terrestrial life and the likelihood of it's existence. 

These are currently the most accepted possible solutions without going into other theories.

## First civilisation

## The last of our kind
Maybe we're the last of our kind and...
Although this is much less likely than other theories as there is a high probability we would have seen lot's of evidence of previous life forms. 

## Alien life may be too incomprehensible
Another idea is that some forms of alien life are just so vastly different from life on earth that we haven't considered to look for them. As such it would be quite difficult to communicate with such life forms and all our current means of communication might prove to be trivial. 

## Humanity might be too hostile
Humans don't exactly have a track record of being peaceful to people of different race, religion, ethnicity, nationality and so on. If aliens did know about us then I'd imagine we don't exactly seem like the best hosts.
## Alien life is too far our
The universe is a big place, as in really big, billions of light years across. It is possible that we are unlucky and live in the middle of nowhere while other civilisations might be closer together. 

## Some alien species might isolate themselves in virtual worlds
The final step of evolution might be virtualisation. A species might be so advanced that they have developed a method to completely live virtually in order to use minimal resources and potentially live forever. Similar to the oasis...

## Proof of life?
Talking about aliens is hard without venturing off into conspiracies...
